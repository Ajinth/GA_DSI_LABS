    "A university has chosen your consulting firm to help them understand and improve their standings in the Times rankings of universities.  Your company will be presentings your findings to a review board from the university Friday afternoon at 4pm.  The review board consists of members from across the university: both professors and administrators.  Your presentation must contain both a technical defense of your work and solid recommendations to move forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will draw on the skills you have learned over the past three weeks to create a model of university prestige using the provided predictors. Specifically, your goal is to **predict the total score for each university for the year 2016**. This score directly maps into the university ranking.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Basic python and pandas skills\n",

    "The data is in a csv file in your repo. It contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **world_rank** - world rank for the university. Contains rank ranges and equal ranks (e.g. = 94 and 201-250).\n",
    "- **university_name** - name of university.\n",
    "- **country** - country of each university.\n",
    "- **teaching** - university score for teaching (the learning environment).\n",
    "- **international** - university score international outlook (staff, students, research).\n",
    "- **research** - university score for research (volume, income and reputation).\n",
    "- **citations** - university score for citations (research influence).\n",
    "- **income** - university score for industry income (knowledge transfer).\n",
    "- **total_score** - total score for university, used to determine rank.\n",
    "- **num_students** - number of students at the university.\n",
    "- **student_staff_ratio** - Number of students divided by number of staff.\n",
    "- **international_students** - Percentage of students who are international.\n",
    "- **female_male_ratio** - Female student to Male student ratio.\n",
    "- **year** - year of the ranking (2011 to 2016 included).\n",
    "\n",
    "### The target for our model is the **total score**, which directly corresponds to the final ranking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note: A total score reported as \"-\" should be considered a 0, and '-' entries in the submisison will be scored as  0. Consider the implications of this for calculating the loss (MSE).\n"

    "- Load the packages you need to do analysis\n",

    "- Check your data for problems, clean and munge data into correct formats\n",

    "    + Final answers should be submitted by filling in the predicted values for each university in the **submission sheet**. (.to_csv() should be useful for this). Note there are three columns: Rank, Name, and Score. The row order matches the rankings list from the 2016 data.\n",
    "    + Your submission will be assessed on MSE for the Score column -- so consider your loss functions! <br><br>\n",

    "    + Defend your model selection\n",
    "    + Defend your model performance\n",
    "    + Interpret the model\n",
    "    + Give clear guidelines to improve rankings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remember your audience contains some experts who will want to understand the strength of your predictions, others who will want to know they are getting the best version possible, and still more who only want to know which actions will help their ranking the most.  Do your best to meet all these demands without alienating anyone."
