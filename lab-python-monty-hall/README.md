# Monty Hall Problem

[The Monty Hall Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) stems from the gameshow "[Let's Make a Deal](http://www.letsmakeadeal.com/)" (Monty Hall was the original host).

Essentially the problem boils down to this:

> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick door No. 2?" **_Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?_**

# Deliverable

Using the Jupyter notebook provided, create a Monte Carlo simulation that runs through 10,000 iterations of each strategy (i.e. sticking with your original door vs making the switch) to answer the following question:

Does each strategy produce the same odds (33%), or is one strategy more profitable than the other?
