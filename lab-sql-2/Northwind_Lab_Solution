--Answer 
/* Categories table consist of the categories of the products that are being sold. Customers table has the customer information, with the associated customer attributes. Employee table has the employee information. Products table has the details of the products being sold. It is almost like an inventory table for products. Orders table has the details of the orders being placed. 
*/
 
/*
The Categories table joins back to the product table on the 'categoryid'. 'categoryid' is the foreign key in the products table. The customers table joins back to the orders table in the 'customerid'. The employee table joins back to the order table on the 'employeeid'. The product table joins back to the order details table on the 'productid'. The orders table joins to customers table on the 'customerid'; Orders table also joins back to the order details table in the 'orderid'. Finally the Orders table also joins back to Employee table on the "Employee Id"
