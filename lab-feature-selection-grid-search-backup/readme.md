# Feature Selection and Grid Search Lab

In this lab, we will practice the following techniques:

1. Use of Classification Models (`KNeighborsClassifier` and `LogisticRegression`)
2. Use of Feature Selection Tools like Regularization, `SelectKBest`, and `RFE`
3. Use of `GridSearchCV`

Please note that this lab is **very** open-ended. While solution code is provided, it is not our intent for that solution code to be the _only_ solution to the model. Modeling is iterative and you likely will find different solutions than we have -- that is not only expected, but encouraged!
